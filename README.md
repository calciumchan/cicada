CICADA ENGINE<br>
an SDL2 wrapper engine made to set up basic functions i use while making games.<br>
SDL requires a fair amount of code to get up and running, as well as lacks certain drawing functions and control handling.<br>
the main goal of this engine is to simply streamline SDL2, especially in areas like setting up windows, input handling, and multiple object handling. this is so that i can use SDL2 and c++ for game development without having to write a ton of code each time i start a new project, this will come in very handy for game jams or prototyping where time is limited.<br>
this is mostly just for my own sake, i want something that fits my specific needs and as such i dont really think it will be of much use to many other people, however im going to make the whole thing open source in case anyone wants to try to use it or submit pull requests!<br>

if you are interested in helping out, i ask that you follow a few rules to keep things organized and easy to manage:<br>
tabs > spaces<br>
no camel case<br>
seperate your headers and your source code into .h and .cpp<br>
try to make things as cross platform as possible<br>
curly brackets should be on the same line, not one line down<br>



please keep in mind i have no idea what im doing, so this entire things will probably be a god awful mess (please submit pull requests i have no idea what im doing)<br><br><br>

SETUP<br>
i develop pretty much exclusively in linux, so thats what all my work here is geared towards. SDL is cross platform, so it shouldnt be very difficult to get things set up to develop and compile on other platforms, but im not quite there yet. if youre looking to help out with the project, and youre on windows or mac, i would love your help getting things set up to work on those platforms! but for right now im mostly focusing on getting the ground work set so i can actually develop things with this engine.
