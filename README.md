CICADA ENGINE<br>
fuck everything just use C edition<br>
<hr>
please listen to the gitaroo man soundtrack before looking at this code :)<br>
cicada engine is just an SDL wrapper to make game development easier<br>
written in C because fuck you. currently only works on linux because its not done and i dont want to use windows<br>
this is literally just made for me, i dont suggest anyone else actual try to use it seeing as theres a lot of weird fuck illogical things about my code that only really make sense to me.<br>
i want the whole thing to be crammed into a single .h file so i can just install the like 5 SDL dependencies, clone this repo and start making games whenever i feel like it.<br>
C is so fuckin nice dude, dont judge me<br>
